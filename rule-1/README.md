# Rule #1

## One level of indentation per method
Methods should have only one level of indentation. If you have more, it's a sign that your method is doing too many things and should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.

### Benefits:
Improves readability by reducing complexity
Leads to smaller, more cohesive methods
Makes code easier to test and debug
Forces you to name and extract operations, improving the vocabulary of your code

Example: Instead of having nested loops or conditions, extract the inner blocks into their own well-named methods.
